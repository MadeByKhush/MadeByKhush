# MadeByKhush 💻✨

Hey there! I'm Khush.  
This repo is a small collection of things I’ve built while learning web development — using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

It’s not about being perfect — it’s about getting better.  
Some of these are experiments, some are ideas, and all are part of the journey.

Thanks for checking it out.  
More cool stuff coming soon. 🚀
