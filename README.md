## 🧠 Who Am I?

> Just a guy with VS Code open and too many tabs.  
> 👋 I'm **Khush** — a frontend dev who writes more `console.log()` than emails.

This repo is not a portfolio.  
It’s a **dev lab** — where code is raw, and progress is real.

I’m not here to impress.  
I’m here to improve.

## ⚙️ What Lives Here?

- ✨ UI Concepts  
- 🔧 Tiny Tools  
- 🧩 JavaScript Experiments  
- 🧪 Weekend Projects  
- 🔁 Failed Attempts (that taught something)

All written with **VanillaJS**, styled with **hands**, and deployed with **hope** 💀
